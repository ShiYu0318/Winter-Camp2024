Chasing dreams, we go on,
Overcoming challenges till dawn.
Determined, we never cease,
Eager to tackle every piece.
Forging strength with each trial,
One step at a time, mile by mile.
Reaching heights we never knew,
Courageous souls, our spirit true.
Embracing passion, it endorses,
Sailing the vast ocean.
