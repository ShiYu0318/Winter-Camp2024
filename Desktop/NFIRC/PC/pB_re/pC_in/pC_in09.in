Hey, I'll write a poem with glee,
Over here to help, that's me!
With coding wonders, let's set free,
Together we'll learn, you and me.
Oh, how I'll help make coding a rule!
Creating lines of binary, so cool,
Obviously, I can not understand.
Deciphering the language pool,
Eagerly we'll learn, never a fool.
