In the realm of numbers, let me portray,
Nestled in the realm of mathematics, I say,
To describe a concept in a poetic way,
Eagerly, I'll craft an acrostic for "integer" today,
Grasping its meaning, I shall display,
Expect a verse that illuminates in a playful array,
Revealing the essence of "integer," I convey.
